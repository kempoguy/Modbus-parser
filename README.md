This is a simple project to mess about wnad blow the rust/dust of some old C knowledge.
The program will accept a Modbus pcap file as an input and present an analysis of the content including timing and potential (simple)security vulnerabilities.
If you use the '-r' switch, it will create a markdown report in the same directory as the input pcap which presents the same analysis info in a written format.

This is a work in progress. It may never get finished. It probably has errors. It is not intended to be perfect secure code.

This project was a collaboration with Claude AI. 

Proejct Intro video is a short explanation of how this works.
